# Learning Angular
 A repo that I will come back to for refreshing my angular knowledge.

Refer to the Doc for references.
Understanding the projects can be difficult...
The Doc contains conclusions, tips and steps for basic stuffs.


PS: Learning Angular for working on Ionic so will only touch concepts that are required in my own project.
